# edge-point-inspection-of-steel-plates
Research programme on edge point inspection of steel plates

I use three solutions:
1. Traditional Detection Method: Using Canny Edge Detection
2. Small Model Detection: Using YOLOv8
3. Large Model Detection: Using Segment Anything

Please take a look at the PowerPoint presentation "A Brief Analysis of Steel Plate Edge Inspection Methods" I made during my internship, which summarizes the details of this project
